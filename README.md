## Stakeholders

Allison Cao: Senior, New York University, Finance & Data Science Major, 21 Years Old, Female:

How she currently manages her finances: "I currently track my expenses using a paper notebook. I manually record every expense, categorize them, and calculate my monthly spending."

Some pain points she currently experiences: "The biggest challenge is the time and effort required for manual entry. Because I have to go home to get my notebook, I also struggle with keeping track of cash expenses. It would be great to set clearer financial goals, but that is super hard with my notebook method. Finally, with a digitial platform, it will be great to be able to analyze my spending habits and identify areas where I can cut back."

Some goals she has for an expense tracking app: "I'd love an app that can automatically sync with my bank accounts and credit cards to capture transactions. Once it has these details, it should categorize expenses and provide insights on my spending habits. I also really want it to have budget tracking and goal setting features. Another awesome feature for it to have is an inutitive user interface."

Another of Allison's concern: "As it has all of my financial diata, data secuirty would be a top concern. Obviously, the app must have strong encryption, personal privacy controls, and an option to anoynmize my data."
